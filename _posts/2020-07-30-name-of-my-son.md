title: Name of my son

Our newborn son just arrived in the early morning on July 26, Sunday.
My wife and I decided to name him "Luke".

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_(name)),
> The name Luke is the English form of the Latin name Lucas.
> It is derived from the Latin name Lucius, and it either means "the great Lucius", or it is a shortened form of the Latin name.
> Lucius means "the bright one" or "the one born at dawn"

Meanwhile, Luke is not just his English name, but also the alphabet spelling of his Chinese name "麓(lù)珂(kē)".

"麓" means "foothill", for he was born in Mountain View, the city located at the foothill of the Santa Cruz Mountains.
This character also has the same pronunciation as "Six"(陆) of the Chinese capital number character, for he was born on June 6 (06/06) of Chinese Lunar Calendar.
(Six is also considered to be the lucky number in China, similar to 7 in the western culture.)

"珂" means "pure white jade-like stone", with our wish of being a bright person of him, similar to the meaning of the Latin origin of his English name.
