title: A Lemma in Graph Theory

When solving a puzzle, I found the following lemma:
**the parity of the number of even-degree vertices toggles after removing a vertex.**
In other words, if the number of even-degree vertices is odd, it will become even;
if the number of even-degree vertices is even, it will become odd.
Proof is given in [my note](https://www.dropbox.com/s/up385wnihmvo0p1/ZYC006.pdf).
