There is a puzzle being asked in my company mailing list:

> You keep randomly drawing balls from the bag, until the bag only has one color in it.
> What is the probability that the bag has only white balls?

Here is my answer and analysis to this puzzle: [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lflykpdb1rvlzd3/ZYC005.pdf)
