Unlike Java and C#, you don't have to build a class to define a function.

The function will return the value of the last expression.

~~~ruby
def tell_the_truth
    true
end
~~~

### Array

~~~ruby
a = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
# this is just syntactic sugar
a[-1]  # => "e"
# accessing undefined array elements does not raise an error
a[100]  # => nil
# this is not syntactic sugar. 0..1 is a Range, inclusively
a[1..3] # => ["b", "c", "d"]
# exclusive Range
a[1...3] # => ["b", "c"]
a[1..100] # => ["b", "c", "d", "e"]
~~~

~~~ ruby
# :[] is just a method of Array
[].methods.include?(:[])
# this is equivalent to a[1..3]
a.[] 1..3

a = [1]
a.push 1
# => [1,1]
a.pop
# => 1
~~~

### Hash

The keys can be any type of object

~~~ ruby
h = {1=>"a", 2=>"b"}
h = {:string=>"a", :array=>[1,2,3]}
~~~

the difference between string and symbol

~~~ ruby
"string".object_id
# => 70152809790160
"string".object_id
# => 70152809784160
:string.object_id
# => 267228
:string.object_id
# => 267228
~~~

Use hash to support named parameters

~~~ ruby
def tell_the_truth(options = {})
    if options[:profession] == :lawyer
        "it could be believed that this is almost certainly not false"
    else 
        true
    end
end

tell_the_truth :profession => :lawyer
# => "it could be believed that this is almost certainly not false"
# Notice: remember that ruby evaluates string as true, so it is almost just as good that the result is not fully true.
~~~

### Code Blocks and Yield

~~~ ruby
3.times {puts "hello"}
# use braces when code block is on one line and use do/end when it is more than one line

[1,2,3].each do |n|
    puts n
end
~~~

You can use `.call` or `yield` to call a block.
Notice that `yield` is totally different in Ruby and Python

~~~ ruby
def call_block(&block)
    block.call
end

def call_block_with_yield
    yield
end

call_block {puts "test"}
call_block_with_yield {puts "test"}
~~~

### Class

~~~ ruby
class TestClass
    # this is a read-write attribute
    attr_accessor :rw_attr
    # this is a read-only attribute
    attr :r_attr

    @instance_var = "this is a instance variable"
    @@class_var = "this is a class variable"

    CONST = "this is a constant"

    def initialize
        puts "this method will be called when you do TestClass.new"
    end
end
~~~

You can open up an existing class and add a method

~~~ ruby
class Fixnum
    def my_times
        i = self
        i.times {yield}
    end
end

3.my_times {puts "test"}
~~~

A ruby class can inherit from only one parent, called a `superclass`

~~~ ruby
4.class
# => Fixnum
4.class.superclass
# => Integer
4.class.superclass.superclass
# => Numeric
4.class.superclass.superclass.superclass
# => Object
4.class.superclass.superclass.superclass.superclass
# => BasicObject
4.class.superclass.superclass.superclass.superclass
# => nil
~~~

4 is a instance of `Fixnum`, `Fixnum` is a instance of `Class` and `Class` is a subclass of `Module`.

~~~ ruby
4.class
# => Fixnum
4.class.class
# => Class
4.class.class.superclass
# => Module
4.class.class.superclass.superclass
# => Object
~~~

You see! Everything has a common ancester, `Object`.

### Mixin

Ruby uses modules to solve multiple inheritance. (Python and C++ can multiple inherit. Java use Interfaces)

A module is a collections of functions and constants. When you include a module in a class, those functions and constants become part of the class.

~~~ ruby
module ToFile
    def filename
        "object_#{self.object_id}.txt"
    end

    def to_f
        # you do not have to close a file if you use code block
        File.open(filename, "w") {|f| f.write(self.to_s)}
    end
end
~~~

~~~ ruby
class Person
    include ToFile

    attr_accessor :name

    def initialize(name)
        @name = name
    end

    def to_s
        name
    end
end

# this will save the name of the person into a file
Person.new("czheo").to_f
~~~

### Modules, Enumerable and Sets
`enumerable` and `comparable` are critical mixins in Ruby.
`enumerable` must implement `each` and `comparable` must implement `<=>`

comparable

~~~ ruby
"begin" <=> "end"
# => -1
"same" <=> "same"
# => 0
2 <=> 1
# => 1
~~~

enumerable

~~~ ruby
a = [5,3,4,1]
a.sort
# => [1, 3, 4, 5]
a.any? {|i| i > 6}
# => false
a.all? {|i| i > 0}
# => true
a.collect {|i| i * 2}
# same as map
# => [10, 6, 8, 2]
a.select {|i| i % 2 == 1} # odd
# same as find_all
# => [5, 3, 1]
a.max
# => 5
a.member? 2
# false
a.inject {|sum, i| sum + i}
# same as reduce
# => 5
~~~

### Self-Study

change hash to array

~~~ ruby
{:a=>1}.to_a
# => [[:a, 1]]
~~~

iterate through a hash

~~~ ruby
{:a=>1, :b=>2}.each do |key, value|
    puts key, value
end
~~~

### Do

~~~ ruby
# solution 1
(1..16).to_a.each_with_index do |v, idx|
    if (idx + 1) % 4 == 0
        p v
    else
        print v, " "
    end
end
# solution 2
(1..16).each_slice 4 do |a|
    a.each {|i| print i, " "}
    print "\n"
end
~~~
