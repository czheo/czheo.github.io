Recently, construction started at a park near my home. It has presented me with a unique opportunity to observe the intricacies of a construction site up close. Having majored in urban planning, I find it especially enlightening to witness these procedures firsthand.

Just today, I noticed a new addition to the site â€“ straw wattles. They were installed along the edges. A shallow trench was dug specifically for placing these wattles. They weren't simply laid down; the wattles were anchored securely with long wooden stakes. Moreover, the ends of the wattles overlapped, ensuring their stability.

I did some research for the purpose of these installations and found that they might be mainly for sediment control.

Before construction, the park's terrain was covered by a dense spread of wild plants, holding the soil together. However, as construction advanced, the natural vegetation was removed, and the once compact dirt would be loosened.
This transformation poses a risk, especially during storms. Rainwater could wash away the loose dirt and other construction debris, spilling it onto the nearby roads. This not only disrupts traffic but can also block the street drainages. These wattles act as barriers, effectively preventing sediment and debris from leaving the construction site.

Another possible purpose is to act as cushions, protecting the adjacent concrete sidewalks from being accidentally damaged by construction machineries.
